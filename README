# Mission
#
As stated in the title and description, this project is to enable us to control low level SYSTEM and KERNEL properties.
Our goal is to achieve the best performances and best battery life at the same time.

If you want to help me debugging the cortexbrain script that is the biggest part of this project, have a look at the file /nohup.out in your phone.
